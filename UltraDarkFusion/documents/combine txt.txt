Combining Text Files Functionality
Connecting the Button
combine_txt_button.clicked.connect(self.on_combine_txt_clicked): This line connects the "Combine Text Files" button (presumably named combine_txt_button) to the on_combine_txt_clicked function. When the button is clicked, the on_combine_txt_clicked function will be executed.
combine_txt_flag and on_combine_txt_clicked
combine_txt_flag: This boolean variable is used to prevent multiple simultaneous executions of the on_combine_txt_clicked function. It's set to False initially and will be set to True when the function starts executing. After the function finishes or encounters an error, it's set back to False.

on_combine_txt_clicked: This function handles the logic for combining the contents of two text files into a new text file.

It first checks if the combine_txt_flag is already True, which would indicate that the function is already running. If so, it prints a message and returns early.
Then, it sets combine_txt_flag to True and disables the "Combine Text Files" button to prevent multiple executions.
The function opens file dialogs to let the user choose the paths for the first and second text files (file1 and file2), as well as the output file path (output_file).
It checks if the user cancels any of the file dialogs. If so, it sets combine_txt_flag back to False, re-enables the button, and prints a message before returning.
If all paths are chosen successfully, the function opens the chosen files for reading (file1 and file2) and the output file for writing (output_file).
It then iterates through the lines of both file1 and file2, writing each line to the output file.
After the combination is complete, it shows a success message using a message box and sets combine_txt_flag back to False. It also re-enables the button.
If any errors occur during the process, it displays an error message using a message box, sets combine_txt_flag to False, and re-enables the button.
