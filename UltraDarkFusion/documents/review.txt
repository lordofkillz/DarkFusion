3. Image Display and Interaction

Function: Show labeled images on the UI for inspection.
Usage: When using the "Review" function, you can click on an image in the list to display it on the main display area for closer inspection. This allows you to thoroughly review the labels applied to the image.
4. Removing Labels and Images
