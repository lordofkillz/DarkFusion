Training

The Script Training tab is a crucial component of the script, enabling you to configure and initiate the training process for your model. Before proceeding, ensure you have followed the steps outlined in the Create Files tab to create the necessary training files.

Getting Started
Browse for obj.data: Locate and select your obj.data file, which is essential for setting up the data configuration.

Browse for Configuration File (cfg): Find and select your configuration file (.cfg). Note that you must edit the configuration file in the CFG Edit tab to set parameters such as classes, max batches, subdivisions, image dimensions, and any desired augmentations. For your convenience, the UltraDarkfusion feature will automatically handle the necessary calculations.

Browse for Weights: Choose the weights file you wish to train from. These weights will serve as the starting point for the training process.

Training Flags
Cache: Enabling this option will cache images during training, potentially enhancing performance.

Show Chart: Enabling this option will ensure that the training chart is displayed continuously.

No_map: By selecting this flag, you opt to train the model without utilizing a map.

results.txt: Enabling this option will generate a detailed training log named Traininglog.txt, providing comprehensive insight into the training output.

Clear Weights: Activating this option will reset the maximum batches in the weights, enabling you to initiate training from scratch.

3GPU: This flag allows you to utilize three GPUs for training, potentially expediting the process.

2GPU: By enabling this option, you can train the model using two GPUs.

Random: Selecting this option will introduce randomization to your training images, diversifying the training process.

Training Output
Throughout the training process, the following metrics and information will be displayed:

Progress: A visual representation of the training progress.

Loss: Indication of the loss value during training.

Map: Mean Average Precision (mAP) value, a key performance metric for object detection models.

Next Map: Prediction of the next mAP value based on the current training progress.

Training Time: Duration of the training process.

Stop Training: Option to halt the training process at any time.

Ultralytics Train
In this section, you can utilize  Ultralytics training process:

Combobox: Choose the desired training mode from detect, segment, classify, and predict.

Size: Select the image size for training.

Epochs: Determine the number of training iterations (epochs) you wish to execute.

Batches: Set the number of batches for each training iteration. The default is 1.

Model: Choose your .pt weights file, which can be found in the weights folder. This file contains your model's pretrained weights.

Data: Choose your obj.yaml file, which should have been created in the Create Files tab. This file defines your dataset's properties.

At the bottom of this section, a QLabel displays a GIF. You can customize the GIF in the Label tab. GIFs are stored in the Styles folder, so you can add your preferred GIFs as needed once darknet starts training this will display the chart.png.

Button Connections:

browse_data.clicked.connect(self.browse_data_clicked): Connects the "Browse Data" button to the browse_data_clicked function.
browse_weights.clicked.connect(self.browse_weights_clicked): Connects the "Browse Weights" button to the browse_weights_clicked function.
train_button.clicked.connect(self.train_button_clicked): Connects the "Train" button to the train_button_clicked function.
File Browsing Functions:

browse_file_clicked: A general function for browsing and selecting files. It updates labels with selected file paths.
browse_data_clicked: Calls browse_file_clicked to handle data file selection.
browse_cfg_clicked: Calls browse_file_clicked to handle config file selection.
browse_weights_clicked: Calls browse_file_clicked to handle weights file(s) selection (multiple files).
Train Button Clicked Function (train_button_clicked):

Builds the command for training based on selected data, config, and weights files.
Adds various command options based on the user's GUI input (e.g., GPU selection, logging, caching).
Creates a TrainingThread to run the training command asynchronously.
Connects the TrainingThread to update GUI statistics and outputs.
Handles stopping the training process when needed.
Utility Functions:

get_total_images: Extracts the total number of training images from the data file.
get_max_iterations_from_cfg: Extracts the maximum iterations (max_batches) from the config file.
update_gui_stats: Updates GUI labels with statistics during training.
reset_gui: Resets GUI components to initial state after training stops.
open_file_dialog: Opens a file dialog for selecting files.
TrainingThread Class:

This class runs the training process asynchronously.
It captures output from the training process and emits signals to update GUI statistics.
The run method starts the training process, while the _reader method captures and processes the output.
It provides a stop method to stop the training process.
It contains logic to handle stopping the training based on specific conditions.
WorkerSignals Class:

This class is used to define the signals emitted by the TrainingThread.
The provided code demonstrates a comprehensive GUI application for training a machine learning model using the Darknet framework. It handles various aspects of the training process, such as selecting files, starting training, monitoring progress, and stopping the process. Please note that this is only a portion of the complete GUI application, and other parts of the application, including GUI layout and initialization, are likely defined elsewhere in the code.
