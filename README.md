## ðŸš€ Getting Started with Installation

Before diving into the code, let's set up your environment with the necessary build tools. Open up a command prompt and execute the following commands to download Git and CMake. These are essential tools for version control and building the project, respectively Install Git and cmake close the terminal after your done this allows it to refresh otherwise you may recieve and error.
## Installation Guide

install neccessary build tools 
   ```sh
   winget install git.git
   winget install Kitware.CMake
   winget install Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.Community
  ```

 **Note**: It's crucial to install Visual Studio before CUDA. If you change your Visual Studio version later, you'll need to reinstall CUDA.

      click on the "Windows Start" menu and run "Visual Studio Installer"
      click on Modify
      select Desktop Development With C++
      select python development
      click on Modify in the bottom-right corner, and then click on Yes
      After installation, A system restart is required. 
   
      
 Clone UltraDarkFusion Repository:
   Warning: If a different version of OpenCV and contrib are already installed in your environment, ensure they are updated to match the required version for UltraDarkFusion.

   Begin by navigating to dir c:/ using the command prompt. Following that, execute the commands below to clone the UltraDarkFusion repository and the specified versions of OpenCV and contrib:
   
   ```
   cd C:/
   git clone https://github.com/lordofkillz/DarkFusion.git
   cd DarkFusion
   git clone --branch 4.7.0 https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git opencv-4.7.0
   git clone --branch 4.7.0 https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib.git opencv_contrib-4.7.0
   mkdir anaconda build install 
   ```

**NOT OPTIONAL**: Download the SAM folder for Grounding DINO and SAM weights. This complete folder can be obtained from the following source: [SAM Folder Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JLH7kMc6FXdKz1fmoxO5AfLhASDzmpw8/view?usp=sharing). Extract it to `c:/darkfusion/ultradarkfusion` or you will need to change the source code.

**OPTIONAL** download my weights folder collection of mscoco pretrained .weights, .cfg and .pt its (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hMwNzGi2DnA19SbQdoA0OXCYzk8LwOPP/view?usp=sharing).

## Anaconda Setup for UltraDarkFusion

The Anaconda setup is an essential step for managing the project's dependencies. Follow these detailed steps to ensure Anaconda is installed and configured correctly.

### Download Anaconda

**Download Anaconda Installer**:
    - Visit the official Anaconda website at [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) and download the installer that matches your system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

### Install Anaconda

**Run the Anaconda Installer**:
    - Locate the downloaded Anaconda installer executable file (`.exe` for Windows, `.sh` for Linux, or `.pkg` for macOS).
    - Run the installer. During the installation process, ensure to set the installation path to `c:\DarkFusion\anaconda` to keep project dependencies organized.

### Configure Your Environment

**Execute `fusion_install.bat`**:
    - After the Anaconda installation, navigate to your DarkFusion project directory.
    - Find the `fusion_install.bat` file, right-click on it, and select "Run as administrator". This step is necessary to configure the environment and install the required dependencies.

By following these steps, you will have Anaconda installed and configured, ready to support the UltraDarkFusion project environment.


     
**Install CUDA and Cudnn:
   - Install CUDA 11.8.0. Download it [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive).
   - Download cuDNN 8.7.0 from [NVIDIA Developer](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn). Extract the contents to `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8`.
   - Optionally, download directly from my Google Drive [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PIdG6qZnyfhNFF7vUVNoX5fDMtwgy5uJ/view?usp=sharing).

**Download the TensorRT zip file from NVIDIA: 
   [TensorRT-8.6.1.6 for Windows 10](https://developer.nvidia.com/downloads/compute/machine-learning/tensorrt/secure/8.6.1/zip/TensorRT-8.6.1.6.Windows10.x86_64.cuda-11.8.zip)

 Extract the contents of the zip file to `C:\DarkFusion\UltraDarkFusion`.
    Open a anaconda prompt
```
   conda activate fusion
   cd C:\DarkFusion\UltraDarkFusion\TensorRT-8.6.1.6
   pip install python\tensorrt-8.6.1-cp38-none-win_amd64.whl
   pip install graphsurgeon\graphsurgeon-0.4.6-py2.py3-none-any.whl

   pip install onnx_graphsurgeon\onnx_graphsurgeon-0.3.12-py2.py3-none-any.whl
   pip install protobuf==3.20.3
```
copy the files from tensorrt-8.6.1.6\lib folder to `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\bin`
   
**Compile OpenCV with CUDA:
  Run the `cuda.bat` script to compile OpenCV with CUDA support.
