## üöÄ Installation Guide

### Required Build Tools
Open Command Prompt and run:
```batch
winget install git.git
winget install Kitware.CMake
```

### Visual Studio 2019
- Download and install [Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition](https://my.visualstudio.com/Downloads?q=visual%20studio%202019)
- Ensure **Desktop Development with C++** and **Python Development** workloads are selected.

### Install CUDA and cuDNN
- Install [CUDA 12.6](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive)
- Download cuDNN compatible with CUDA 12.6 from [NVIDIA Developer](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn)
- Extract and copy cuDNN files to:
  ```
  C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v12.6
  ```

### Clone UltraDarkFusion Repository and OpenCV
```batch
cd C:\
git clone https://github.com/lordofkillz/DarkFusion.git
cd DarkFusion
git clone --branch 4.9.0 https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git opencv-4.9.0
git clone --branch 4.9.0 https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib.git opencv_contrib-4.9.0
mkdir build install
```

### Mandatory Downloads
- [Download SAM Weights and Files](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1Tux3ncgLcCagQ0N3cC25XP4O_UwsjXbP)
  - Extract to `C:\DarkFusion\UltraDarkFusion`


### Anaconda Setup
- Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).
- Accept default installation settings.

### Setup Environment
- Run `fusion_install.bat` as administrator to create and configure the environment:
```batch
cd C:\DarkFusion\
fusion_install.bat
```
### Compile OpenCV with CUDA (Optional)

To compile OpenCV with CUDA acceleration (recommended for improved performance):

```batch
cd C:\DarkFusion\
fusion_cuda.bat
```

### **Goals for UltraDarkFusion**  
- [ ] **Remove OpenCV DNN and create a Python wrapper for Darknet** 
- [ ] **Add support for OBB (Oriented Bounding Boxes)** in development  
- [ ] **Remove the document-based help and train a chatbot for assistance**  
- [ ] **Improve code efficiency (Ongoing...)**  
- [ ] **Upload UltraDarkFusion to PyPI for easier installation and distribution**
